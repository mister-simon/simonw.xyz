# simonw.xyz

Here it is, possibly. My new personal website, portfolio, blog. Whatever this might be.

Soon it will all be clear. It's going to be a good time.

Until this is ready, the live project is to be found at the confusingly similar repository name [simon-w.xyz](https://github.com/mister-simon/simon-w.xyz). The dash in the repo name was a mistake, tbh.

## Dev

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm i`:

```sh
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
