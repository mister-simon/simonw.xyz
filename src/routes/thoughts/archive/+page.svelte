		<h1>Archived Thoughts</h1>
		<p>
			These posts were written with vue components in mind. This new version of the site runs on
			sveltekit and as a result, all the old Vue components no longer function. I intend to fix that
			at some point, but until then, expect some things in here to be a little iffy.
