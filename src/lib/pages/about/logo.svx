# The Simonw.xyz Logo

![]({logoImg})

## Foreground: The symbol

This symbol combines these two characters `/>`. In HTML this is the signal that the current element should be self closing. In overlapping those characters slightly, they combine into a much more interesting singular symbol with a real sense of energy and movement.

The font used for this is [Mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) by Matthias Tellen. It's one of a few monospaced programming fonts I use daily. The proportions of the characters and the quality of the linework is exactly what I was looking for.

Some features of the symbol:

- Web dev theme with the /> shape
- X, Y, and S/Z shapes
- An implied movement, as of a person running to the right
- A black outline affixes the symbol to the backdrop and facilitates a monochrome option, when the white fill is not possible or effective.

## Background: The black circle

This anchors everything in space, effectively setting the weight and impact of the logo. I chose to allow the symbol to break out of the space. There's some symbolism there, but it also just helps to balance the lines, while accentuating the `/` line.

I experimented with a few shapes, and the circle simply felt the best to me.

# The Monochrome Version

![]({logoCutoutImg})

By punching out the white section of the full colour version we end up with a very clean looking single colour variant of the logo.
