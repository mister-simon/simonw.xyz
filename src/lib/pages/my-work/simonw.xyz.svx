# Simonw.xyz - This Site

A personal portfolio inspired by TUI applications and file managers. Made with *Sveltekit*, *tailwind*, *mdsvex*.

## Objectives

- Create something a bit different - but still familiar
- Flexible minimal design, TUI / Pixel art inspired
- Friendly to employers, curious devs, clients, search engines
- Space for professional content
- Space for fun side-projects and any other write-ups
- Use Stylix to generate a 16 colour base palette

## Timeline

- Research + gathering inspiration
- Conceptualising + designing
- Pallete generation
- Blank canvas (empty SvelteKit project)
- Mocking up the base layout (3 columns)
- Exploring server code to back the navigation system using vite's `import.meta.glob` to gather contents
- Scaffolding site structure
- Refining the node tree system used to populate the navigation panes
- Refining the layout to handle smaller screen / portrait
- Implementing a full-screen toggle mode, to hide nav panels
- Adding more visual appeal with pixelised icons
- Improving typographic consistency using Monaspace fonts
- Integrating markdown files into navigation population
