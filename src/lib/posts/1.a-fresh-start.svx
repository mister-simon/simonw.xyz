# A Fresh Start

I wrote quite a lot last year, and now it's in the [archive](/thoughts/archive). This is a fresh start!

Now we're working with Svelte, and writing using [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/). It's been relatively smooth sailing so far compared with my early work on the Nuxt version of my site, where I spent days battling content queries and code highlighting.

## There's lots to do on the blog

- Page tagging
- Index pages for everything, including tags
- Next / Previous post buttons for easy traversal
- Wrangling cover images into check
- Improved content layout options (breakout / lightboxes? / copy code btns / etc)
- Anchor links surrounding content headings
- Improve external link handling (_blank, noopener, etc)
- Default sorting of thoughts by latest first...?

## There's lots to do elsewhere

- Content for all the top level pages... I've gone down a bit of a rabbit-hole with the Thoughts section
- Refactoring the navigation system... I'll need to think about this a lot, as I want to make it a lot more flexible, but for now it's workable.
- Keyboard shortcuts, though that's pretty low on the priority list.

## There's issues

... And that's a good thing! I should be running this show via github issues to keep me on track somewhat. This will be a good week for making progress over here I think.
