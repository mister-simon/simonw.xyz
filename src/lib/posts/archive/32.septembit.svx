I animated every day for a month.

I also made a website to showcase everything about this project in full. So check the finished template out, below or click it to go to my septembit site.

A little bit about the site:

- [mister-simon/septembit-2024](https://github.com/mister-simon/septembit-2024) is free to browse on github
- Made with svelte 5 and sveltekit with SSR
- All the gifs are at their 1x size (very small) and scaled up with the css rule `image-rendering: pixelated`.

This whole thing was a lot of fun!

I've not really done much pixel art since. I honestly needed a break by the end and life has been pretty busy, but I would most definitely do it again.

I really hope Saul does a stream going over everyone's work, because everyone was so great in the discord, sharing their work, ideas and support.
