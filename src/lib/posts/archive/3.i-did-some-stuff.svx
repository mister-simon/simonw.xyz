Actually making progress improving this blog section. More focussed on improving functionality and understanding the Nuxt Content module than researching stuff today.

So there's not much time left in my day to actually talk about what I've done in any detail...

In short:

1. Got to grips with content queries
   1. ... Why is my sort not sorting how I expected - newest first
2. Dropped custom rendering of ContentNavigation to see what defaults are used
3. Added a layout to the blog area
   1. Todo: Refactor this layout into an actual layout... Or at least make use of components.
4. Added some style to the index page + increased homepage text sizes
