My output here has been patchy for many reasons. One of which is simply that I would rather be working on other things. Maybe when I have time this should be one of those things.

Vue was the first proper front-end framework that really clicked with me, and there's a reason why I came back to it to throw some experiments out into the world on this domain. However, lately I'm mostly just writing markdown and ignoring bugs on this site.

If I were to rebuild this site I may want to do some things differently:

- Investigate [Astro](https://astro.build/)
  - The ability to work with different frameworks is interesting from a porting / experimenting perspective
  - More Svelte - less Vue ðŸ‘€
- Generally improve the landing page
- Put blog content first
  - Tag, search, filter, paginate posts, etc
  - RSS?
  - Improve code examples
- Some amount of design cohesion
- Simplicity?
- Move away from vercel?
- Pull latest content from Bluesky, as I've become more active there than here in the day-to-day.

That's a bunch of stuff. A bunch of work. It'll be a fun project I'm sure.

However! The project I'm currently working on is a website for my wedding. Password protected details, RSVPs, etc. I chose to swap back to Laravel to get the job done quicker.

Honestly, if I were to rebuild this website in Laravel I could probably whip something really competent up in no time... But I'm trying to have fun and learn some new things along the way.

Anyway... All this is to say, it's in writing now. I want to rebuild.
