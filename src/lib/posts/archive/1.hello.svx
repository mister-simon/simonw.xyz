My intention here is mostly to try and document / link out to other useful articles that I come across in my day-to-day.
<!--more-->

So, to get started I dropped this into my terminal:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

I tend to read a handful of articles each day. Most of them lead to more questions. Sometimes they give me answers to questions I have down the line... And sometimes when I want those answers they only exist in my mind as the frustrating knowledge that I've forgotten all relevant specific information I'll need.

Ok, so this is a little while later. I've been trying to implement a couple of things here:

1. An index page that shows extracts of the blog posts with a link
2. A list of blog posts using the "ContentNavigation" component system

Sounds simple right? Weeeeell, not exactly. It's simple enough, but the documentation is pretty bad. For example, currently I can't decide how I would simply output the nav list of content `/content/thoughts-and-things/*` because wildcards don't seem to be a thing, and the documentation also doesn't point you in the direction of dealing with the recursion you'll need to handle to deal with displaying navigation children.

Well... I'll come back to this next week.

So far, this is progress.
